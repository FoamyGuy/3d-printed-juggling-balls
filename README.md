OpenScad Juggling Ball
----------------------

One ball is made up of 3 total parts. Two halves and one threaded rod to connect them together.

Big thanks to aubenc. The threaded rod comes from [his thing](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8796)

The STL is a 44mm diameter ball I like this size but you are free to tweak it in the scad file if you want.

The star pattern on the bottom of the half ball makes it a bit easier to pry the peace off of the build plate for me (LulzBot Mini).

The threaded rods are set to 2mm outer diameter smaller than the whole. For me the rods fit pretty loosely, but with both halves screwed together it creates a firm connection.
