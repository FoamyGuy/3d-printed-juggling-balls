One ball is made up of 3 total parts. Two halves and one threaded rod to connect them together.

So far the metal insert version is holding up much better under use than the 100% plastic ones.

### Brass fastener version:

The plastic threaded rods kept breaking when I drop the balls and they hit too hard. I've been playing around with these threaded inserts lately and figured this would be a good use for them. I put one in each half and then cut down a small threaded rod to serve as the connector pin.

I used 8-32 threaded rod with matching [brass press-fit expansion inserts](http://www.mcmaster.com/#standard-threaded-inserts/=zbno3k)

### 100% printed version:

Big thanks to aubenc. The threaded rod comes from [his thing](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8796)

The STL is a 44mm diameter ball I like this size but you are free to tweak it in the scad file if you want.

The star pattern on the bottom of the half ball makes it a bit easier to pry the peace off of the build plate for me (LulzBot Mini).

The threaded rods are set to 2mm outer diameter smaller than the whole. For me the rods fit pretty loosely, but with both halves screwed together it creates a firm connection.
